# üçï Chef Portfolio üçî

## About
Chef Portfolio gives users a chance to share/find great new recipes. 
All users have the ability to create, edit or delete their recipies; users can search for / filter the recipes they see based on the 
name of the recipe or by the name of their favorite recipe creator.

## Motivation
This project began as a group project and has since been re-written/re-developed to more closely align with a new direction for the app.
The goal for this app is to give people a convenient place to share a recipe they are proud of, or to search for a new recipe to share 
with their friends and family.

## Tech Used
- JavaScript
- React
- Sweetalert
